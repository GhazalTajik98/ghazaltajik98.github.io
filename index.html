        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            This is Ghazal Tajik.I got my BSc Computer Engineering degree from Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology with CGPA 17.16/20 (US CGPA 3.60/4) in Iran. In general, my research interest is Natural Languages Processing. More specifically, I am interested in both traditional and Deep Learning-based approaches to problems such as semantics learning. I am also interested in human activity recognition and its applications. I believe the ultimate solution to many computer vision problems lies where traditional algorithms, Deep Learning, and geometry constraints meet. Therefore I'm actively looking for ideas utilizing these together.

        <p>
            Right now, I am experimenting with a few different areas such as weakly supervised object detection and inherently interpretable models.
